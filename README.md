### Type system
- Static type system
   - Determine the variable type statically before executing the code.
   - Java
- Dynamical type system
   - Determine the variable type dynamically while executing the code.
   - Javascript 
- Gradual type system
   - Ensure type safety through pre-execution checks.
   - Automatically infer the type of variables.
   - Typescript
- Property-based type system
   - In other words, Structural type system.
   - A structural type system determines type equality based on the structure (i.e., properties and methods) of the type. 
   - Two types are considered interchangeable if they have the same structure, even if they have different names.
   - Typescript, Go, Scala
- Nominal type system
   - A nominal type system determines type equality based on the name of the type. 
   - That is, even if two types have the same structure, they are considered different types if their names are different.
   - Java, C#, C++
